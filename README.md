# Gruntled Extension

### by @borntonguyen & @leepriscilla & @rickyg365

Gruntled is a browser extension that allows users to record their reaction to a video, generate a link so they can send to friends that will consolidate their reactions to the respecive video.

Here's a link to an [in-progress prototype.](https://projects.invisionapp.com/d/main?origin=v7#/console/21954568/465300953/comments?scrollOffset=150.5454559326172)

<h5 align="center">  Prototype Instructions </h5>
1) Zoom out of prototype (if needed){'CTRL' + '-'} <br>
2) Click anywhere on the proto to highlight hotzones to progress through the prototype. <br>
3) Press 'C' to toggle comments at anytime.

<h5 align="center">  Hypothesis </h5>

We believe creating a reaction-sharing browser extension for all media content consumers will give users more enjoyment & connection.
We will know this is true when we see an increase of reaction videos created with our extension
